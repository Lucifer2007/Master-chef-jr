MAGGIE RECIPIE



I guess maggi noodles is one such recipe which i started to cook from my school days. i loved maggi masala noodles so much that there are days i used to consume it twice a day. my mom use to pack maggi masala noodles for my lunch and after i return back home i use to prepare it for my evening snack. i still remember 5 rupees noodles packet which was more than sufficient to quench the maggi noodles craving. i guess maggi has stopped now to sell 5 rupees small packet.
